#                          Technology and LEF layer map
# Design "mini_mips_fakepad"
#
# Technology and LEF layers are mapped automatically by encounter.
# If a user needs customised mapping, specify a layermap file. Layermap file
# is specified using command "setExtractRCMode -lefTechFileMap <layermapFile>".
#

# Mapping of layers are from <lefLayer> to <techLayer>

# Lef file might contain multiple masterslice layers. Only one is printed in log file.
# Encounter does not distinguish between masterslice layers in TQRC/IQRC extraction.
